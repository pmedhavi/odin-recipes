    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. Typically baked until bubbly and golden, lasagna is known for its hearty, comforting qualities and is a popular choice for family meals and gatherings. The combination of flavors and textures—from the savory meat sauce to the gooey cheese—creates a satisfying and flavorful meal.</p>
